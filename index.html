            <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

            <p>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
                    <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
                    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
                    everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
                    Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
                    We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
                    learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

            <h2>Founders</h2>
            <p>
                    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
                    Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
                    sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
                    <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

            <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>
            <p>
                Michael is the creator of the <a Href="https://railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails tutorial</a>
                and principal author of the <a href="https://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a><
                introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of <a href="https://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a>
                and has three-step plan for World domination.Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are slightly 
                exagerated.
                
                You should follow Michael on Twitter

            <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
            <p>
                    When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
                    on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
                    interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
                    interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.
                    
                    You should follow Lee on Twitter

                  </p>
        
            <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
            <p>You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
                    Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
                    at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
                    tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.<br> 

                    You should follow Nick on Twitter
